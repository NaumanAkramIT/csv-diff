This command will compare `file1.csv` and `file2.csv` and output the differences.

## Command-Line Options

|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `-k, --keys`   | Specify composite keys for comparison.   |
| `-o, --output` | Specify output format (e.g., JSON, CSV).|
| `-h, --help`   | Display help information.                |
| `-v, --version`| Show the version of the tool.           |

## Examples

### Basic Comparison

To compare two CSV files without any options:

```bash
csv-diff file1.csv file2.csv
```

### Using Composite Keys

If you want to compare based on specific columns, use the `-k` option:

```bash
csv-diff -k column1,column2 file1.csv file2.csv
```

### Outputting in JSON Format

To get the differences in JSON format, use the `-o` option:

```bash
csv-diff -o json file1.csv file2.csv
```
